"What do you know about happiness?" — Yoda

Chef is happy only if three conditions hold:

    Chef finished cooking a delicious meal
    Chef got AC for a programming problem with an almost correct code
    Chef got a new problem with a sequence of integers

Today, all three conditions are satisfied. Chef would like you to feel his happiness and provide him with a solution for this new problem with a sequence of integers. The problem is as follows.

You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,AN
. You need to determine if it is possible to choose two indices i and j such that Ai≠Aj, but AAi = AAj

. (If it was possible, Chef would be truly happy.)
Input

    The first line of the input contains a single integer T

denoting the number of test cases. The description of T
test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N
.
The second line contains N
space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN

    .

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Truly Happy" if it is possible to choose required indices or "Poor Chef" otherwise.
Constraints

    1≤T≤1,000

1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤N
for each valid i
the sum of N
over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105

Example Output

Truly Happy
Poor Chef
Poor Chef
Truly Happy

Explanation

Example case 1: Chef is truly happy because AA3=AA1
and A3≠A1

.

Example case 2: There is no pair of indices which would make Chef truly happy.
For instance, AA3=AA4, but A3=A4
