All submissions for this problem are available.Chef is making polygon cakes in his kitchen today!

Since the judge panel is very strict, Chef's cakes must be beautiful and have sharp and precise internal

angles in arithmetic progression.

Given the number of sides, N
, of the cake Chef is baking today and also the measure of its first angle(smallest angle), A, find the measure of the Kth

angle.
Input:

    The first line contains a single integer T

, the number of test cases.
The next T
lines contain three space separated integers N, A and K, the number of sides of polygon, the first angle and the Kth

    angle respectively.

Output:

For each test case, print two space separated integers X
and Y, such that the Kth angle can be written in the form of X/Y and gcd(X,Y)=1

Constraints
